# Setting up layers and creating task sequences

![Rhino Layers]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/RhinoLayers.png "Rhino Layers")

Place geometry needed for each task on a new Rhino layer. Give the layer a name that can be used to identify the task. In some applications it may be possible to automate the creation of layers and assignment of geometry using parametric models like Grasshopper. For example, in masonry applications each course of bricks is placed on a layer identifying that course. The user wearing the HoloLens can then use Twinbuild to adjust the layer visibility to display whatever course is currently being built.
