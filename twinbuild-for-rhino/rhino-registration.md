# Definining and publishing registration marker locations in Rhino

After setting up model geometry, coordinate space and layers you can optionally locate registration codes within Rhino. If you are planning to use features of the CAD model to locate codes (e.g. at column grid intersections, slab edges, face plates of beams etc) then it can be easier to define these locations using object snaps in Rhino than manually entering XYZ coordinates for each code in the Twinbuild web application. Use the _TwinbuildQR_ command to define the position of a new code. Codes will be given automatically generated IDs that can be changed in the web application after publishing if necessary.
