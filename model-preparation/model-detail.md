# Simplifying models for augmented reality

Viewing very detailed models (>1M polygons) on the hololens can limit CPU / GPU resources available for tracking and reduce hologram precision. In almost all cases highly detailed models are not necessary for construction and manufacturing tasks, and application performance can be significantly improved by simply eliminating details that are extraneous to the task at hand. Avoid showing details that will not be visible, remove textures from materials and work with simple model formats (boxes, curves and linework) where possible.
