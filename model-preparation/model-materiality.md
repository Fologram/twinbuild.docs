# Selecting appropriate materials for augmented reality

Holograms rendered as surfaces can obscure parts of the physical environment that need to be visible to carry out a task. Rendering surface models on the hololens with textures or reflective materials can also distract workers from following spatial guides and reduce the immersion of the experience by creating screendoor effects or the appearance of pixelated surfaces. Generally speaking, avoid surface models and the use of textures on the HoloLens to ensure the physical environment is always visible to the user.
