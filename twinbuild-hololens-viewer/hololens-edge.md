# Loading models from the Team Model Dashboard

Turn on the Hololens 2, connect to the internet, launch Edge and sign in to your twinbuild account at app.twinbuild.com. Tap on a model thumbnail to download the model to your HoloLens and launch Twinbuild. After the model has been successfully loaded, scan two or more registration codes in your physical space to locate the model at 1:1.
