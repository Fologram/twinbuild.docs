# Placing Models with Registration Codes

To view a downloaded model in your physical space, walk over to any one of your registration markers and look at the code with the HoloLens 2. When the code is detected, the scaled precision model will snap in place. Walk to a second code and repeat the scanning process. When the second code is detected, the model will scale to 1:1. Repeat this process with remaining codes. For optimal results, scan each code 2 or 3 times as this will also enable the HoloLens to build up tracking data within your workspace.

### Notes on Code Detection

Code detection will be impacted by the distance of the HoloLens from the code, the materiality of the code (matte surfaces like paper scan more successfully than screens or reflective laminate), the brightness of lighting on the code (very bright or very dark spaces can be difficult to detect codes in) and objects occluding any part of the code.
