# Loading locally cached models offline on the HoloLens

Make sure your HoloLens 2 device has previously downloaded the model you are wanting to view. Turn on the HoloLens 2 and scan the Link for the model to launch Twinbuild and load the locally cached file. After the model has been successfully loaded, scan two or more registration codes in your physical space to locate the model at 1:1.
