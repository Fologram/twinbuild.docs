### Twinbuild for HoloLens User Interface

The Twinbuild user interface is designed to be as simple and unintrusive as possible. It contains tools for easily accessing HoloLens settings, Twinbuild models and editing layer properties.

To open the Twinbuild user interface on the HoloLens, look at your palm. You can grab and drag the menu to move it in your space and can close the menu at any time by tapping the Exit icon.

The layer panel displays all layers in the model. Layers visibility can be toggled on and off with the icon to the right of the layer name. Toggling visibility for a parent layer will hide all child layers. Individual layers can also be isolated (hiding all other layers) by tapping the isolate button to the far right of the layer name. Note that isolating a child layer will not hide geometry on the parent layer.

Layers can be isolated in sequence by tapping the Next Layer or Previous Layer buttons. This allowsa user to quickly step view individual layers one at a time for completing task sequences (e.g. displaying courses of bricks). All layers can be made visible by tapping the Show All button.
