# Loading models from Links

On a mobile or PC, sign in to your account at app.twinbuild.com and click on the model you want to view on the HoloLens. Then click the View in AR button to display the Link to the model. By default model Links expire after 5 minutes to prevent unwanted model access. If you need to print the code for offline or repeated access, click Print to generate a printable PDF of a persistent Link to the model. Persistent model Links expire after one year.

Turn on the Hololens 2 and connect to the internet. Scan the Link with the Hololens 2 to download the model and launch Twinbuild. After the model has been successfully loaded, scan two or more registration codes in your physical space to locate the model at 1:1.
