# Loading published models on the HoloLens from connection codes

On a mobile or PC, sign in to your account at app.twinbuild.com and click on the model you want to view on the HoloLens. Then click the View in AR button to display a code that links to the model. You can screen grab this code and save, email or print it if necessary.

Turn on the Hololens 2 and connect to the internet. Scan the model link code with the Hololens 2 to download the model and launch Twinbuild. You may be asked to sign in to your Twinbuild account in the Edge browser on the HoloLens to confirm permission to view the model. After the model has been successfully loaded, scan two or more registration codes in your physical space to locate the model at 1:1.
