# Publishing Revit models with section boxes

![Revit Section Box]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/RevitSectionBox.PNG "Revit Section Box")

Use Revit Section boxes to view models in plan, or to view a smaller section of a larger model to ensure that all parts of the hologram are walkable and reachable in Twinbuild. Twinbuild will only export parts of the model contained in the clipping box, and the section box will not be editable after publishing.
