# Understanding augmented reality terminology

_Drift_ - Movement of hologram position from original placement location in the working environment

_Feature Points_- Unique points of interest that are tracked by the onboard cameras of the HoloLens

_GLTF / GLB_ - “Graphics Library Transmission Format / Graphics Library Binary”, a data format for exchanging 3D models on the web

_IFC_ - “Industry Foundation Classes”, a data format for exchanging BIM models

_IPD_ - Inter Pupil Distance used by the HoloLens to correctly display the depth of holograms on the stereo display.

_Connection Code_ - A QR code containing a link to a model hosted on the cloud

_Publishing_ - The process of packaging, compressing, and previewing a model in a web browser

_Registration Code_ - A QR code used to correct for hologram positional error by fixing a point in model space to a point in physical space

_SLAM_ - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. SLAM algorithms are used by the HoloLens to estimate camera motion from visible feature points

_Tracking_ - Estimated motion of the HoloLens determined by SLAM

_Tracking Loss_ - Inability of the HoloLens to determine motion or position due to insufficient feature points visible to onboard cameras
