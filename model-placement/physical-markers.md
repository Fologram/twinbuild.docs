# Best practice for working with physical Markers

Twinbuild registration codes can be printed, laminated and reused from project to project.

It is important to follow best practice when creating printed QR codes to ensure they are easily detectable by the hololens and precisely located in physical space.

### Code size

Location codes should be printed at a size that ensures they are easily visible to the hololens during typical occupation of a site or workspace. Generally speaking A4 or A3 prints are appropriate for most use cases. Larger codes will be detected by the HoloLens from greater distance but do not track more precisely than smaller codes detected nearer to the HoloLens camera.

### Reusable codes

Registration codes can be laminated for durability and reusability across projects. Use a matte surface laminate to reduce reflection and glare and improve detection on the HoloLens.

### Codes on objects - magnets, etching and stickers

Registration codes can be printed on any surface to make placement on objects simpler. Printing on magnetized surfaces allows registration codes to be quickly fixed to steel benches and parts, and QR codes can be etched or stencilled on timber pieces for precise registration. Stickers can also be used to permanently fix QR codes in manufacturing spaces.
