# Aligning holograms with large moving objects

For large objects that can be easily oriented to digital models (e.g. objects with a flat base) it is possible to fix registration codes directly to the surface of the object enabling the object to be moved and still aligned to a hologram. These codes can be located at known distances along edges of the part, in corners of the part, or arbitrarily etched if manufactured with CAD CAM processes.
