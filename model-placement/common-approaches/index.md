# Choosing number and location of registration markers to suit your application

Twinbuild models are located in physical space at 1:1 scale using two or more registration codes.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This section outlines common marker placement strategies for specific use cases of Twinbuild. For rapid visualization and small scale projects it may be sufficient to locate only two markers using a tape measure. On construction sites with known reference points (e.g. column grids) it may be useful to use these reference points for efficiently locating markers. For manufacturing and factory environments where a single space may be repeatedly used for different applications, maximum precision can be obtained by ensuring an even distribution of markers within the space.
