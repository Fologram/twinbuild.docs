# Uniformly distributed markers in workshop and production environments

In environments where holographic models will be frequently displayed in the same location (e.g. production lines or workshop benches), registration codes should be placed approximately 4000mm apart to cover the work area for optimal precision. These codes can be placed in an ad-hoc fashion and later digitized using LIDAR scans or professional surveying equipment. After defining the position of these codes in the Twinbuild web application (or using the TwinbuildQR command in Rhino) they can be shared between published models to simplify the registration process.
