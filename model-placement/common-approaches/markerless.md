# Placing models without markers for quick previews

Models are loaded at desktop scale in Twinbuild be default. When models are first loaded in Twinbuild they will appear approximately 1500mm in front of the HoloLens and scaled to fit a 1500mm bounding box. This preview can be moved, scaled and rotated using the default two handed pinch and drag gestures on the holoLens. This default preview is useful for performing quick visual checks to identify model performance on the HoloLens 2, suitability of details and materials and whether the model is the correct version for a given task. It is not recommended to use the preview for carrying out tasks as placement is not repeatable and scale is not reliable.
