# Placing small models with two markers

A minimum of two registration codes are required to view models at 1:1 scale in physical space. The simplest way to reliably and repeatedly locate models at 1:1 is using two registration codes placed several meters apart using a tape measure. This placement method will be sufficient for quick previews in office environments, or for very small (<4000mm) fabrication tasks. At a larger scale two codes will be insufficient to correct for hololens drift.
