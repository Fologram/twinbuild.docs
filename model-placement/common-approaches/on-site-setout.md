# Placing models on site using existing physical features and setout points

Location codes can be quickly located on construction sites using either known setout points (e.g. column grids or surveyor marks) or measured distances along existing built features (slab edges or intersections between slabs and walls). Take care that any physical features that are used to place registration markers are themselves reliably positioned as imprecision in physical features will lead to corresponding imprecision in hologram location.
