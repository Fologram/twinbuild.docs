# Maximizing model legibility in augmented reality

While it is possible to publish entire BIM models to Twinbuild, the excess of content may reduce legibility for the end user, especially when working with large models where objects in the distance may distract from objects in the immediate work area. Holographic models should be overlaid on physical surfaces where possible as this significantly improves the legibility of hologram depth and the ability of workers to use holographic models as spatial guides.
