# The importance of model reachability in augmented reality

The perceived accuracy of holographic models is best nearest to the display due to lever arm effects introduced by rendering objects at a distance on a display that is very close to the user’s eyes. The best Twinbuild experiences ‘fit’ within a physical space so all holograms are walkable and reachable by the end user. Design experiences to show individual parts one at a time or use clipping boxes of large objects if necessary.
