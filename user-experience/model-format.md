# Choosing an appropriate model format for your application

Most manufacturing and construction tasks can be described in a simple vector format. Where possible, it is best to describe holographic tasks using simple 2D and 3D curves and lines as these will not occlude physical objects in the environment and can be easier to use as spatial templates for layout, setout and QA tasks. Avoid working with 3D surface geometry unless this is absolutely critical for the end user.
