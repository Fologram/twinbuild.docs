# Adding and importing registration codes

### Adding and editing registration codes

The coordinates of registration codes can be defined using the TwinbuildQR command in Rhino or entered manually by clicking on the Register button in the Twinbuild web application after uploading a model. These codes will be used to place your holographic model in physical space, and correct for drift in the hologram as users move between codes. Enter the X, Y and Z coordinates that will be associated with the registration code and click Accept to save the code. If you are planning to re-use existing physical codes you can also edit the randomly generated ID of the code.

If you need to delete or change the coordinates or ID of any existing codes, click on the blue code label in the 3D viewport to open the code dialog. Make your changes and click accept to confirm them.

### Importing registration codes from existing models

You can import registration codes from any model that you have published to your Twinbuild account. Click on in the import icon to copy code positions from an existing model. This is useful when working with multiple digital models within the same physical space (e.g. a production line or workshop).
