# Working with the Twinbuild Web Viewer

Twinbuild consists of three distinct software components: plugins for supported third party CAD applications, a viewer for the HoloLens and a web application for managing accounts, 3D assets and registration codes. The web application can be used on mobile devices to easily display connection QR codes for viewing models on the HoloLens, or even while working with the Twinbuild application on the HoloLens by launching the Edge browser.
