Twinbuild QR Link codes expire after 5 minutes to prevent accidental or unwanted access to published models. If you are unsure when the Link code will be used to download a model, you can create a printable code with a one year expiry that can easily be emailed or shared. Be careful generating printed codes of secure data.

After downloading a model on the HoloLens using a Link code, the model will be cached on the device for accessing offline. While the HoloLens is offline, you can reload a cached model on your device using any Link code (newly generated, expired or printed) for that model.
