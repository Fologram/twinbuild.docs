# Uploading models to your Twinbuild account

After signing in, click on the Upload button to upload the model preview to the model dashboard for your team. Note that large models may take longer to download or lead to performance issues on mobile devices and the HoloLens.

If your account is not part of a team with a Twinbuild subscription you will be asked to sign in to a valid team. Contact your team administrator for an invitation to an existing team, or request a free 14 day trial of Twinbuild to get started on your own.

After the upload has completed you will be able to add registration markers and create a Link for viewing the model on the HoloLens 2.
