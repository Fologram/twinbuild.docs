# Managing Seats and Devices

![Manage Device view]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/20_Twinbuild_Account_AssignedDevice_crop.png "Manage Device view")

Twinbuild will automatically assign available license seats to any Hololens 2 device that scans a Link to a model published by your team. You can view a list of all devices with assigned seats in the Manage Seats and Devices view on your account dashboard. If you are working with a borrowed device or otherwise need to free up a seat, contact our support team and provide a reference to the ID you would like removed.
