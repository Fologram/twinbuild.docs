# Downloading and publishing the precision test model

You can use the Precision Test model on the HoloLens to set out and measure discrepancies between corner points of a unit grid (1m or 3ft) and evaluate precision within your work space. Results will be affected by both holographic drift caused by non-optimal environmental conditions together with the accuracy of Marker locations used to correct for this drift.
