# Downloading and publishing the precision test model

You can use the Precision Test model on the HoloLens to set out and measure discrepancies between corner points of a 3000mm grid and evaluate precision within your work space. Results will be affected by both holographic drift caused by non-optimal environmental conditions together with the accuracy of registration marker locations used to correct for this drift.
