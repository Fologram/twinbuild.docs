# Viewing the test model on the HoloLens

When you are ready to carry out the precision test, ensure your HoloLens 2 is switched on and connected to the internet and any available Windows Updates have been downloaded and installed. You can confirm your device is up to date by opening the Settings app and navigating to Updates and Security > Check for Updates.

On your mobile / laptop, visit https://app.twinbuild.com/account/models and open the Twinbuild_Precision_Test model. Click on View in AR to display the QR code that links to the model. Ensure that your laptop / mobile phone screen is on full brightness and not reflecting anything that would prevent QR code detection, then look at this QR code on the HoloLens 2 and tap the Play button that appears to download and load the model. Accept any prompts that appear to launch Twinbuild. The precision test model will initially load at desktop scale and within your field of view.

### Notes on Code Detection

Code detection will be impacted by the distance of the HoloLens from the code, the materiality of the code (matte surfaces like paper scan more successfully than screens or reflective laminate), the brightness of lighting on the code (very bright or very dark spaces can be difficult to detect codes in) and objects occluding any part of the code.

### Locating the Test Model in your work space

Walk over to any one of your Markers and look at the code with the HoloLens 2. When the code is detected, the scaled precision model will snap in place. Walk to a second code and repeat the scanning process. When the second code is detected, the test model will scale to 1:1. Repeat this process with remaining codes. For optimal results, scan each code 2 or 3 times as this will also enable the HoloLens to build up tracking data within your workspace.
