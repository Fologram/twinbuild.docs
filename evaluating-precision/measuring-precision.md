# Measuring precision from discrepancies between setout points

Using a measuring tape, measure the edge lengths between crosshairs in the 3000mm grid. These should each be exactly 3000mm. Precision is determined by the discrepancy between the measured distance and 3000mm and may not be uniform throughout your space.

### Factors affecting precision in the test

The proximity of the crosshair to a Registration marker, human error in marking out from the crosshair and human error in measuring distance between marked crosshairs will all affect the discrepancy of individual measurements. Some areas of the workspace may track better than others due to environmental factors, and some Registration markers may be more accurately located than others and so measured precision may not be uniform throughout the test.

### Maximum precision

If Registration markers are accurately positioned to 1mm and the workspace has been set up to be optimal for HoloLens tracking you should expect measured differences to be 0-3mm due to human error and the fidelity of the HoloLens display.
