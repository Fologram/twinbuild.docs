# Setout from the test model using the HoloLens

While wearing the HoloLens 2 and viewing the precision test model, use masking tape to roughly indicate the position of the cross hair geometries laid out in the grid. Then using a fine tipped pen or pencil, mark out the center point of each crosshair on the masking tape. If you are working from a simple linear array of markers, drift correction will be optimal along the axis of the grid defined by the markers.

### Obtaining Optimal Results

For best results, spend some time walking around in your workspace and scanning the positions of Markers before setting out the locations of the crosshairs. Ensure that the HoloLens 2 is calibrated for your eyes and comfortably fitted to your head, and avoid performing the precision test in a crowded environment.
