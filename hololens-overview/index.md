The HoloLens is an untethered holographic computer running Windows 10 that can be used to create mixed reality experiences rendered on a transparent, stereoscopic display.

Mixed Reality experiences blend digital content with physical spaces, enabling digital models to be used as templates and guides for carrying out physical work. These experiences can be shared between multiple participants who can view the same digital models in the same physical place as if they were actually present. This improves the ability to discuss and communicate 3D information and to collaborate on complex spatial tasks.
