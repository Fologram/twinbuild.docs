# HoloLens Overview

The HoloLens is an untethered holographic computer running Windows 10 that can be used to create mixed reality experiences rendered on a transparent, stereoscopic display.

The transparent display enables digital content (called 'holograms') and physical environments to be seen clearly at the same time, and a flip up visor enables workers to rapidly jump in and out of mixed reality as necessary. Users interact with holograms using a combination of voice and hand gestures and the device can be used entirely hands free with no need to connect external hardware or controllers. This makes the HoloLens 2 well suited for use by front line workers completing manual tasks.

Mixed Reality experiences blend digital content with physical spaces, enabling digital models to be used as templates and guides for carrying out physical work. These experiences can be shared between multiple participants who can view the same digital models in the same physical place as if they were actually present. This improves the ability to discuss and communicate 3D information and to collaborate on complex spatial tasks.
