# Setting up the HoloLens for the first time

All HoloLens devices will need to be linked to a Microsoft Account and connected to WiFi on first use.

## Creating a Microsoft Account

You will be prompted to choose whether your organization or you as an individual own your HoloLens 2 device. For small organizations we recommend setting up your HoloLens 2 as an individual as this may remove some administrative burden. However you should, if applicable, consult with your IT department regarding your particular policy/security needs.

### My work or school owns it:

Setting up your HoloLens 2 for an organization requires an Azure AD account and central management from your IT department. If you are choosing this option you will need your Azure AD credentials (which may redirect you to your organizations sign-in page).

### I own it:

Setting up your HoloLens 2 as an individual requires a personal Microsoft account (you can set one up for free [here](https://account.microsoft.com/))

## Connecting to WiFi

Your Hololens will need to be connected to the internet to install Twinbuild and download models, after which point Twinbuild can run offline if required. If you are setting up your HoloLens 2 out of the box, Cortana will prompt you to connect to an available WiFi network during setup. If you are using a shared device or working in a new location, you may need to reconnect your device:

To connect to wifi, launch the Settings app from the home screen.
Open the Network and Internet page.
Make sure Wifi is turned on.
Choose a network.
Enter your username and password.

The HoloLens has known issues verifying security certificates with some enterprise networks. For further Reading refer to [Microsoft's Guide to Connecting Hololens to Wifi](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens-network)
