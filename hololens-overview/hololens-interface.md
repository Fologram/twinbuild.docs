Applications on the HoloLens 2 are accessed through the Windows Home menu. To open or hide the Windows Home Menu , hold out one of your hands with the palm facing up and look at your wrist. You should see a holographic Microsoft Windows logo on your wrist. Tap on the logo or touch your index finger to your thumb in a pinching motion.

To interact with a tile in the menu or any other 'button' element, push your finger through the element as if pressing a physical button. To interact with buttons that are not within arms react, hold up your hand to display a cursor and hand ray. When the cursor is over the element you wish to interact with, tap your index finger and thumb together to 'click' the element.

Small popup notifications on the HoloLens 2 will prompt you when you can interact with content using voice commands. A complete list of supported voice vommands is available on [Microsoft's Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/voice-input).
