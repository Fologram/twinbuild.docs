# Calibrating the HoloLens for your eyes

Calibration adjusts the IPD of your hololens to match your eyes and improve viewing experience.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

If you are using the HoloLens and Twinbuild to carry out a task that requires high precision (e.g. anything other than simple visualization) you should complete calibration before undertaking the task. You can complete the calibration process by accepting any prompts to calibrate, or by launching the calibration app from the Settings app in the Windows Home menu. The calibration app is located in System -> Calibration -> Eye Calibration -> Run eye calibration. Before completing the calibration process, ensure that the HoloLens 2 is comfortably fit and centered over your nose and eyes. You can find an extensive guide to HoloLens 2 calibration on the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens-calibration).

The HoloLens will prompt you to calibrate the device when:

- The user is using the device for the first time
- The user previously opted out of the calibration process
- The calibration process didn't succeed the last time the user used the device
- The user has deleted their calibration profiles
- The device is taken off and puts back on and any of the above circumstances apply

The calibration process my fail due to:

- Getting distracted and not following the calibration targets
- Dirty or scratched device visor or device visor not positioned properly
- Dirty or scratched glasses
- Certain types of contact lenses and glasses (colored contact lenses, some toric contact lenses, IR blocking glasses, some high prescription glasses, sunglasses, or similar)
- More-pronounced makeup and some eyelash extensions
- Hair or thick eyeglass frames if they're blocking the device from seeing your eyes
- Certain eye physiology, eye conditions, or eye surgery such as narrow eyes, long eyelashes, amblyopia, nystagmus, some cases of LASIK or other eye surgeries

You can try the following to address any calibration failures:

- Cleaning your device visor
- Cleaning your glasses
- Pushing your device visor as close to your eyes as possible
- Moving objects in your visor out of the way (such as hair)
- Turning on a light in your room or moving out of direct sunlight
