# Electrical Installation

Install complex cabling from simple holographic guides and easily service existing structures by viewing in-wall services in mixed reality
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

As with plumbing and other services, Twinbuild can simplify the prefabrication of building components by displaying cable, outlet and fixture locations, and help visualize where cables run through existing structures to minimize material usage, setout time and mistakes. Mixed reality visualisation of services with Twinbuild can also improve coordination of services installation by overlaying construction sites with the location of yet-to-be installed work, thereby reducing the need for cavity space and saving installation time.

### Model Preparation

Use linework to describe cable runs and avoid publishing mesh models of pipes or fixtures if possible. Use colour to differentiate between circuits. When necessary, include low-polygon models of reference geometry (such as wall or floor structure) in the published model to use as a quick visual guide to ensure that digital models are correctly aligned with the physical workspace.

### Marker Setout

Two markers may be sufficient to show the approximate location of cabling and correcly differentiate between circuits. Locate markers at known physical reference points as near as possible to the installation work area. For instance, markers may be located at the corners of interior wall edges defining the installation work area.

### Task Guidance

Follow best practice for [user behaviour]({{site.baseurl}}/hololens-precision/user-behaviour) before performing set out or installation. Walk around the site for 5 minutes and ensure all markers have been scanned. Before starting setout, ensure the closest marker has been recently scanned.

Perform quick visual checks to ensure minimal drift by comparing the holographic model of as built surfaces to the existing conditions on site. If installing cabling, use centerlines to guide installation and bore holes in existing framing or cladding as required.
