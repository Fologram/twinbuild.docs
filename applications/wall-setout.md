# Wall Setout

Twinbuild can be used to precisely set out interior walls and finished surfaces
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Twinbuild can be used to improve productivity and reduce mistakes in common set out tasks such as marking the location of base plates, doors and window openings, finished surfaces and so on. This can be achieved by simply overlaying the floor surface with a 2D plan viewed at 1:1.

### Model Preparation

For simple setout tasks a 2D drawing is sufficient for setout. If working from Rhino, hide all 3D models and publish linework required for the setout task. If working from Revit, export and insert a DXF of the frame drawing into a 3D view to publish to Twinbuild. Assign different colours to framing and finished surfaces for clarity.

### Marker Setout

Use existing site setout points, floor surface edges or column grid to locate markers. Marker positions may need to be moved off the grid to ensure they remain visible during setout and are not under installed base plates. For optimal precision, ensure markers are located ~3000mm apart.

### Task Guidance

Follow best practice for [user behaviour]({{site.baseurl}}/hololens-precision/user-behaviour) before performing set out. Walk around the site for 5 minutes and ensure all markers have been scanned. Before starting setout, ensure the closest marker has been recently scanned. Then, keeping the holographic model centered in the field of view, use a piece of chalk to mark the corners of each base plate. Alternatively, directly place physical base plates following the holographic guide and skip the need for marking out.

The holographic model can also be used to perform quick QA checks on finished surfaces.
